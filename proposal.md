For my final project I want to… 

"Create an anonymous rating tool using Google Plus's People API for pictures and names."

Leveraging Google Plus’s Name, Picture-URL Data, I want to be able to have a user friendly search that can search/query through from the front homepage of my web app. From there the results of said search will populate the top 25 closest matches, and allow the user to paginate through to subsequent pages. 

Clicking on a single result will lightbox the linkedin profile to a details page where the user can append data to my local database connected to the profile. From the details page the user can write reviews and rate them from 1-5. The two data points will append to my local database and will be available for others to see.

I am working with Shuang Wu for this Web App.
